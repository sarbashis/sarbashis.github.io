Currently, I am working as a Senior Researcher Scientist(Computational Biology) in Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab), Uppsala University. I have extensive experience focused on data analysis and modeling using advance Machine Learning algorithms
for high-dimension complex data in the field of Biology.

Currently, I am working on gene expression data from human heart failure patients and my aim to identify genes that are related to different types of heart failure using different Machine learning Methods.

The current era is for Big data analysis using advance Machine Leaning algorithms such as __Deep Learning__. I have a great interest in Machine Learning and its application healthcare.

My research interest broadly are into the field of
__Cardiac Diseases__, __Deep Learning__ and __Microbial Genomics__

Beside working with Data, I like to take landscape photography.

I am open for collaboration in Deep Learning and Data analysis, please contact me over email or linkedin.
