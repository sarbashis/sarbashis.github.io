	abstract = {Mycobacterium phlei, a non-tuberculosis mycobacterial species was first described in 1898-99. We present the complete genome sequence for the M. phlei CCUG21000(T) type strain and the draft genomes for four additional strains. The genome size for all five is 5.3 Mb with 69.4{\%
	} GC content. This is 0.35 Mbps smaller than the previously reported M. phlei RIVM draft genome. The size difference is attributed partly to large bacteriophage sequence fragments in the M. phlei RIVM genome. Comparative analysis revealed: i) a CRISPR system similar to Type-1E (cas3) in M
	. phlei RIVM; ii) genes involved in polyamine metabolism and transport (potAD, potF) that are absent in other mycobacteria, and iii) strain-specific variations in the number of $\sigma$-factor genes. Moreover, M. phlei has as many as 82 mce (mammalian cell entry) homologs and many of the h
		orizontally acquired genes in M. phlei are present in other environmental bacteria including mycobacteria that share similar habitat. Phylogenetic analysis based on 693 Mycobacterium core genes present in all complete mycobacterial genomes suggested that its closest neighbor is Mycobacteri
		um smegmatis JS623 and Mycobacterium rhodesiae NBB3 while it is more distant to M. smegmatis mc2 155.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis remains a major public health problem. Clinical tuberculosis manifests often as pulmonary and occasionally as extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. The emergence of drug resistant tubercle bacilli and its association with HIV is a formidable challenge to curb the spread of tuberculosis. There have been concerted efforts by whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to identify genomic patterns and to establish a relationship between the genotype of the organism and clinical manifestation of tuberculosis. Extra-pulmonary TB constitutes 15--20 percent of the total clinical cases of tuberculosis reported among immunocompetent patients, whereas among HIV patients the incidence is more than 50 percent. Genomic analysis of M. tuberculosis isolates from extra pulmonary patients has not been explored. RESULTS: The genomic DNA of 5 extra-pulmonary clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis derived from cerebrospinal fluid, lymph node fine needle aspirates (FNAC) / biopsies, were sequenced. Next generation sequencing approach (NGS) was employed to identify Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) and computational methods used to predict their consequence on functional genes. Analysis of distribution of SNVs led to the finding that there are mixed genotypes in patient isolates and that many SNVs are likely to influence either gene function or their expression. Phylogenetic relationship between the isolates correlated with the origin of the isolates. In addition, insertion sites of IS elements were identified and their distribution revealed a variation in number and position of the element in the 5 extra-pulmonary isolates compared to the reference M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that NGS sequencing is able to identify small variations in genomes of M. tuberculosis isolates including changes in IS element insertion sites. Moreover, variations in isolates of M. tuberculosis from non-pulmonary sites were documented. The analysis of our results indicates genomic heterogeneity in the clinical isolates.},

abstract = {Like other bacteria, Mycobacterium spp. have developed different strategies in response to environmental changes such as nutrient limitations and other different stress situations. We have identified candidate genes (rsb genes) from Mycobacterium marinum involved in the regulation of the activity of the alternative sigma factor, $\sigma$(F) . This is a homologue of the master regulator of general stress response, $\sigma$(B) , and the sporulation-specific sigma factor, $\sigma$(F) , in Bacillus subtilis. The organization of these genes in M. marinum and B. subtilis is similar. Transcriptome and qRT-PCR data show that these genes are indeed expressed in M. marinum and that the levels of expression vary with growth phase and exposure to stress. In particular, cold stress caused a significant rise in the expression of all identified rsb and sigF genes. We discuss these data in relation to what is currently known for other Mycobacterium spp.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing and polyadenylation were observed pervasively in eukaryotic messenger RNAs. These alternative isoforms could either be consequences of physiological regulation or stochastic noise of RNA processing. To quantify the extent of stochastic noise in splicing and polyadenylation, we analyzed the alternative usage of splicing and polyadenylation sites in Entamoeba histolytica using RNA-Seq. First, we identified a large number of rarely spliced alternative junctions and then showed that the occurrence of these alternative splicing events is correlated with splicing site sequence, occurrence of constitutive splicing events and messenger RNA abundance. Our results implied the majority of these alternative splicing events are likely to be stochastic error of splicing machineries, and we estimated the corresponding error rates. Second, we observed extensive microheterogeneity of polyadenylation cleavage sites, and the extent of such microheterogeneity is correlated with the occurrence of constitutive cleavage events, suggesting most of such microheterogeneity is likely to be stochastic. Overall, we only observed a small fraction of alternative splicing and polyadenylation isoforms that are unlikely to be solely stochastic, implying the functional relevance of alternative splicing and polyadenylation in E. histolytica is limited. Lastly, we revised the gene models and annotated their 3'UTR in AmoebaDB, providing valuable resources to the community.},

abstract = {The organization of genomic sequences is dynamic and undergoes change during the process of evolution. Many of the variations arise spontaneously and the observed genomic changes can either be distributed uniformly throughout the genome or be preferentially localized to some regions (hot spots) compared to others. Conversely cold spots may tend to accumulate very few variations or none at all. In order to identify such regions statistically, we have developed a method based on Shewhart Control Chart. The method was used for identification of hot and cold spots of single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. The predictions have been validated by sequencing some of these regions derived from clinical isolates. This method can be used for analysis of other genome sequences particularly infectious microbes.},

abstract = {The occurrence of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the aetiological agent of tuberculosis (TB), is hampering the management and control of TB in the world. Here we present a computational analysis of recently sequenced drug-sensitive (DS), multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of M. tuberculosis. Single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) were identified in a pair-wise manner using the anchor-based whole genome comparison (ABWGC) tool and its modified version. For this analysis, four fully sequenced genomes of different strains of M. tuberculosis were taken along with three KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) strains isolated from South Africa including one XDR and one MDR strain. KZN strains were compared with other fully sequenced strains and also among each other. The variations were analysed with respect to their biological influence as a result of either altered structure or synthesis. The results suggest that the DR phenotype may be due to changes in a number of genes. The database on KZN strains can be accessed through the website http://mirna.jnu.ac.in/mgdd/.},

abstract = {Large numbers of genomes are being sequenced regularly and the rate will go up in future due to availability of new genome sequencing techniques. In order to understand genotype to phenotype relationships, it is necessary to identify sequence variations at the genomic level. Alignment of a pair of genomes and parsing the alignment data is an accepted approach for identification of variations. Though there are a number of tools available for whole-genome alignment, none of these allows automatic parsing of the alignment and identification of different kinds of genomic variants with high degree of sensitivity. Here we present a simple web-based interface for whole genome comparison named ABWGAT (Anchor-Based Whole Genome Analysis Tool) that is simple to use. The output is a list of variations such as SNVs, indels, repeat expansion and inversion.},

@article{Pettersson2015,
abstract = {We have used RNASeq and qRT-PCR to study mRNA levels for all $\sigma$-factors in different Mycobacterium marinum strains under various growth and stress conditions. We also studied their levels in M. marinum from infected fish and mosquito larvae. The annotated $\sigma$-factors were expressed and transcripts varied in relation to growth and stress conditions. Some were highly abundant such as sigA, sigB, sigC, sigD, sigE and sigH while others were not. The $\sigma$-factor mRNA profiles were similar after heat stress, during infection of fish and mosquito larvae. The similarity also applies to some of the known heat shock genes such as the $\alpha$-crystallin gene. Therefore, it seems probable that the physiological state of M. marinum is similar when exposed to these different conditions. Moreover, the mosquito larvae data suggest that this is the state that the fish encounter when infected, at least with respect to $\sigma$-factor mRNA levels. Comparative genomic analysis of $\sigma$-factor gene localizations in three M. marinum strains and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv revealed chromosomal rearrangements that changed the localization of especially sigA, sigB, sigD, sigE, sigF and sigJ after the divergence of these two species. This may explain the variation in species-specific expression upon exposure to different growth conditions.},
