ï»¿July, 2014 -- Present   | **Researcher/Postdoc**,  Dept. of Cell and Molecular Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.|
                         |  **Project I:** In this project I am modelling myocardial gene expression in patients undergoing elective coronary artery by-pass surgery to identify pattern in gene expression between heart failure patients with pEF (Preserved Ejection Fraction), rEF (Reduce ejection Fraction) and Normal ejection fraction. |
					| **Approach:** The data in size  20000 x 100 matrix.  I have applied Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in R to discriminate between pEF, rEF and Normal. Subsequently gene expression differences was statistically modelled. I further performed   discriminant analysis on data. |
					| **Project II:**  Studying gene expression dynamics in response to different stress in Mycobacteria|
					| **Approach:** Gene expression clustering using different methods such as hierarchical clustering, k-mean etc.|

Feb, 2013 -- July, 2014	 | **Post-doctoral Fellow**, Institute of Molecular Biology, Mainz, Germany. |  
                     |  My project was to understand the dynamics of genome-wide accessible regions during neuronal differentiation. Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements followed by sequencing (FAIRE-Seq) was used to identify accessible genomic regions and corresponding RNA-Seq generated from different cell stages. Preliminary analysis identified several stress specific distal enhancers. |
       
July, 2012 -- October, 2012 | **Guest Researcher**, Dept. of Cell and Molecular Biology,  Uppsala University, Sweden | 
                            | Here I worked on gene expression and transcriptional regulation of Mycobacterium marinum in different stress condition using RNA-Seq data. |
