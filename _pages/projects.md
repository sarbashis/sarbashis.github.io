My research interest broadly in the area of __Cardiac Diseases__, __Microbial Genomic__ and __Machine Learning__ with special focus on Deep Learning. 
 
 
Currently I am working on the following projects:
 
### Deep Learning project:
 
 In this project I am trying to test different __Deep Learning__ models in genomic datasets and trying to understand how these models works 
 


### Heart Failure project:
 
 Heart Failure (HF) is a condition when the heart is not able to pump enough blood to the body. HF is a multifactor disease and can be caused by hypertension, stress, diabetes, age.
  
  There are many other factors are involved with HF. The amount of blood pump by left ventricle is measure as Ejection Fraction (EF). Based on the EF, HF is classified into three categories: heart failure with __preserved__ EF (HFpEF) in this condition the EF is > 50% which is similar to normal, heart failure with __reduced__ EF, where EF < 40% and __mid-range__ EF in which  50 < EF > 40. In this project I am investigating gene expression profiles in different HF types as well as in different heart tissues to identify genes-disease relationship.
