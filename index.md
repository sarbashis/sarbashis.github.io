Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist at *Global Aritificial Intelligence Accelator (GAIA)*, [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en). I have extensive experience focused on data analysis and modeling using advance Machine Learning algorithms for high-dimension complex data in the field of Biology.

The current era is for Big data analysis using advance Machine Leaning algorithms such as __Deep Learning__. I have a great interest in Machine Learning and its application.

My research interest broadly are into the field of
__Machine Leaning__, __Deep Learning__ and __Data Science__

Beside working with Data, I love to take pictures.

I am open for collaboration in Deep Learning and Data analysis, please contact me over email or linkedin.
